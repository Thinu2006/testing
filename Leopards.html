                    The Sri Lankan Leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) is an endemic species found in Sri Lanka. 
                    With its striking coat of grey, black, and buff spots, this magnificent creature is an icon of Sri Lanka's biodiversity. 
                    Leopards are solitary creatures that prefer a mix of evergreen forest, scrub jungle, and open country.

                    Leopards in Sri Lanka can be found in a variety of habitats. Some of the most common venues where they can be spotted include:

                                This national park located on the southeast coast of Sri Lanka is considered one of the best places in the world to see leopards in their natural habitat. 
                                Covering an area of over 97,000 hectares, it has the highest density of wild leopards in the world. 
                                Visitors can take guided safaris through the park's diverse landscapes including forests, grasslands, and lagoons, offering opportunities to spot these elusive big cats.<br>

                                Located in northwest Sri Lanka, this vast national park covers an area of approximately 131,693 hectares and is home to a significant population of leopards. 
                                With numerous water sources such as villus (natural lakes) scattered throughout the park, it provides ideal habitats for leopards and other wildlife.
                                Guided jeep safaris offer visitors chances to observe leopards along with many other species.<br>

                                Situated in central highland region of Sri Lanka, this national park consists mostly of montane grassland interspersed with patches of forest. 
                                At elevations ranging from 2,100â€“2,300 meters, it offers cooler climate compared to lowland parks. Although not as famous for leopard sightings as Yala or Wilpattu, there have been reports of leopards roaming around Horton Plains.
